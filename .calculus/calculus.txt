essence of calculus
#####################
area of circle as pi r square is determined by breaking into lines of length 2 pi r i.e. circoumference and assembling into triangle
breadth of lines is some dummy value dr
so area of triangle is 0.5 * b * h i.e. 0.5*radius*2pi radius i.e. pi r square
how about the area of x squares i.e. parabola i.e. what is something into x that gives its square's area i.e. A(x)?
dA = x^2 * dx
dA
--- = x^2
dx
dA
-- = f(x)
dx
i.e. derivative i.e. whatever this ratio approaches as ds gets smaller and smaller
i.e. how sensitive a function is to small changes in input
derivative of function for area under the graph gives the function to find graph itself
i.e. fundamental theorom of calculus
derivatives and integrals are inverse of each other

paradox of derivative

s = distance
distance travelled in time
distance on y and time on x
s(t)
v(t)
velocity = change in distance / change in time i.e. distance travelled per unit time
i.e. ds/dt i.e. rise/run
s(t+dt) - s(t)/dt in metres per second
ds/dt(t) = s(t+dt) - s(t)/dt
usually slope of line
but as dt approaches 0, it is the tangent line
derivative is best constant approximation for rate of change around a point
solving comes to ds/dt (t) = 3(t)^2
derivative of 3 cube is 3 t square
simplifies problem as we approach 0

derivative formulas through geometry
####################################
eg: f(x) = x^2
square + slightly more = 2 rectangles + small square - ignore square
by calculating, df/dx = 2x
d(x^4)/dx = 4x^3
d(x^n)/dx = nx^(n-1) i.e. power rule
f(x) = 1/x
circle with radius 1
if we cover theta of circle i.e. if we travel radius by theta angle, sin is the height
if we traverse through the circle, height increases and decreases i.e. wave
d(sin(theta))/dtheta = adj/hyp of traingle = cos(theta)

chain rule and product rule
###########################
add functions, multiply functions or apply one on another
minus is just negative multiplication
division is just inverse
derivative of sum of 2 functions is sum of their derivative
d/dx(g(x) + h(x)) = dg/dx + dh/dx
d/dx(g(x) * h(x)) = left d right right d left i.e. d/dx(g(x))h(x) + d/dx(h(x))g(x)
d/dx(2f(x)) = 2*d/dx(f(x))
d/dx(g(h(x))) = dg/dh(h(x))*dh/dx(h)
i.e. chain rule
