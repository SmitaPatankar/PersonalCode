- think of approach
- form flow chart
  - terminator - start/end

  - rectangle - process - sum = a + b
  - diamond - decision making - is sum > 10?
  - arrows - flow/connection
  - circle - connector
- form pseudo code
  - read 2 numbers a and b
  - sum = a + b
  - print sum
- write program/source code i.e. instructions to get task done in any programming language semantics
