# pointers in cpp
"""
array name maps to address of first element in array
for all array indices, gives value at address that many positions ahead of the initial value
eg: in cpp 0th element is at address 100, 1st at 104, 2nd at 108 so on...
size of array is 4 * no of elements in cpp and pointerin cpp is 8 bytes
in cpp, symbol table values cannot be changed

for char array, temp memory is created with all chars and then copied to the name

in cpp pointers are also passed by value to functions

in cpp, when array is passed to func, pointer is passed
we can pass pointer for any location in array to send partial array
