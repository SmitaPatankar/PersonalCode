"""
num=5 makes memory block at an address and stores value 5
print(num) goes to the address and gives data
symbol table is maintained by compiler that maps name num to the address

pointer stores address
pointer itself is a container with an address that holds value of another address
initialize with something or 0 to avoid pointing it at unknown location
now, num and pointer point to same address and can read or write value

function call has copy of original variable that was passed

pointer is of 8 bytes

modification of int copy doesnt affect original

copy of pointer also points to actual value

incrementing pointer address goes 4 bytes ahead if int
