# todo: hw: cpp: read macro types https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/macros-and-its-types-in-c-cpp/
# keywords in cpp
"""

before compilation pi in program will get replaced with 3.14 stored in macro
is reusable and saves storage space and maintenance
cant be changed in program
"""

# todo: python: learn variable scopes - global local etc
# global variables in cpp
"""
share variable between functions
alternative to reference variables
local is for functions
global not recommended as anyone can update it - reference variables are better
"""

# todo: python: inline functions
# todo: python: tertiary operator
# inline functions in cpp

reduces function call overhead
reduces stack space and creates copies in cpp
works for one liners only eg: tertiary operation
before compilation code function call gets replaced with actual logic
"""

# todo: python: default args
# default args in cpp
"""
