# data types

## primitive
- integer
- float
- character
- string
- boolean

## non-primitive

### linear
(sequential)

#### static
(memory location fixed)
- array

#### non-static
(memory location not fixed)
- linked list
- stack
- queue

### non-linear
(not sequential but linked to each other)
- tree
- graph.

# algorithm types
- recursive
(call the algorithm again and again with diff parameters - eg: sum of numbers in array)
- divide and conquer
(divide problem, solve recursively, combine solutions - eg: quick sort, merge sort)
- dynamic programming
(memorization i.e. remember past results and find new results - for optimization)
- greedy
(check best in each step - for optimization)
- brute force
(try all possibilities until solution is found - eg: find best place)
- randomized
(use random number atleast once to make computational decision - eg: quick sort)
