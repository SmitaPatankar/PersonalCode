"""
We can delete unwanted element(cell) in linked list.
In array cell will still exist when we delete value, all elements will be moved backwards and last cell will be empty but still exist in memory and take space.

Don't need to pre-define size of linkedlist unlike array.
i.e we can insert anything to linkedlist but we cant do so to same array if capacity is full.

In array if we insert anything in between, everything gets moved.
In linked list, only link is changed, not the location in memory.

Search can be done easily in array as it is indexed.
In array it is sequential.

Array's element at index can be accessed easily.  
Linkedlist we have to access a position sequentially.
