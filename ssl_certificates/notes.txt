client to server data

symmetric encryption:
same key for encryption and decryption at client and server respectively - not secure

tls - public key encryption:
client initiates - server sends public key - client has symmetric key and encrypts it via public key and sends
server decrypts using private key
client encrypts data with symmetric key and sends
client doesnt know if the public key is of server or sniffer - not secure

certs:
server talks to certificae autority and it makes cert for public key and signs it
CA has pub and priv key
signs with private key
main cert linked to intermediate cert for cert authority for public key
linked to root cert
client to server starts
server sends certs
client verfies with cert authority by using public key of cert authority and encrypting public key of server and see if some content is received
until root - root is self signed
root is on every machine - untrusted root if root goes down
can install root
