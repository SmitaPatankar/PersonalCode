'''
• chain: Combines multiple iterators into a single sequential iterator.
• cycle: Repeats an iterator’s items forever.
• tee: Splits a single iterator into multiple parallel iterators.
• zip_longest: A variant of the zip built-in function that works well with iterators of different lengths.
• islice: Slices an iterator by numerical indexes without copying.
• takewhile: Returns items from an iterator while a predicate function returns True.
• dropwhile: Returns items from an iterator once the predicate function returns False for the first time.
• filterfalse: Returns all items from an iterator where a predicate function returns False. The opposite of the filter built-in function.
• product: Returns the Cartesian product of items from an iterator, which is a nice alternative to deeply nested list comprehensions.
• permutations: Returns ordered permutations of length N with items from an iterator.
• combination: Returns the unordered combinations of length N with unrepeated items from an iterator.
